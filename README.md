# Assignment 2

## Homework 2: : Image and Steganography Analysis
In this assignment, you will analyze a forensic image file to discover how to recover information about processes that were running at the moment the image was taken, and how files can be hidden by changing their information header using byte-edition tools. Also, you will discover some data that has been hidden inside a picture file by means of bit shifting and steganography technology. Before attempting to solve this assignment, please download and install the following open-source software:

 1. Volatility (https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/). 
 2. Hex Workshop (http://www.hexworkshop.com/). 
 3. OpenStego (https://www.openstego.com/).

> **Note** 
> 
> Tools (1), (2), and (3) have been tested on Windows 10 (64 bits). Tools (1) and (2) have been also tested on MAC OS X. Hex Workshop is not available for Mac OS. Usage in other OS has not been attempted. Also, OpenStego needs a Java Virtual Machine (javaw.exe), so if you don't have already in your system please go ahead and download and install Java from https://java.com/en.
